  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <p>
    4 tablespoons unsalted butter room temperature
    2 teaspoons minced shallot
    1 garlic clove minced
    2 teaspoons minced fresh parsley
    2 lobster tails 5-6 ounces each
    2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
    2 4-ounce filet mignon steaks room temperature
    2 tablespoons olive oil divided
    2 teaspoons kosher salt
    1 ½ teaspoons black pepper
    Lemon wedges for serving
  </p>
  <h3>Intructions</h3>
  <p>
    Make the compound butter. In a small bowl, use a fork to combine the softened butter, shallot, garlic, and parsley.
    4 tablespoons unsalted butter,2 teaspoons minced shallot,1 garlic clove,2 teaspoons minced fresh parsley
    Transfer the butter mixture to a sheet of wax paper or plastic wrap. Form the mixture into a 1 ½-inch thick log. Roll tightly and freeze for 10 minutes to solidify, then refrigerate until ready to use.
    Preheat the oven to 375°F, positioning a rack in the center. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and spray with nonstick spray; set aside.
    Prepare the lobster tails. Using kitchen shears, carefully split the top shells of the lobster tails in half lengthwise. Gently insert an upside-down teaspoon between the underside of the shell and the meat and loosen the meat.
    2 lobster tails
    Place the lobster tails on the prepared baking sheet. Drizzle each with lemon juice. Slice 1 pat of compound butter for each lobster tail, cut each pat of butter in half and arrange the two pieces on top of the meat; set aside.
    2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice.
    Prepare the steaks. Drizzle the steaks with 1 tablespoon olive oil, then season both sides with salt and pepper.
    2 4-ounce filet mignon steaks,2 teaspoons kosher salt,1 ½ teaspoons black pepper,2 tablespoons olive oil.
    Heat the remaining oil in a cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add the steaks and sear for 1-2 minutes per side, then place the skillet in the oven and cook for 4-8 minutes, until the steaks reach the desired doneness (for medium-rare: a thermometer should read 125-130°F; medium: 135°F; medium-well: 145°F).
    At the same time, place the lobster tails in the oven. Cook for 6-8 minutes until meat is firm and opaque.
    Remove the steaks from the oven and allow them to rest for 5 minutes while the lobster finishes cooking.
    To serve, arrange the filets and lobster on individual serving plates, top each filet with a pat of compound butter, and garnish with lemon wedges.
